BTLE_ANCS
=========

A WIP for connecting to ANCS.

[ANCS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013460-CH2-SW1) is a way for BTLE devices to connect to and read and control your Notification Center in iOS8(not tested on iOS7 yet, maybe not working any more). (Think Pebble).

I wanted to see what it was all about, so I wrote a Mac client for ANCS.

A few caveats:
* I wrote this late and quick, it's not the best design. I've spent maybe 5 hours on it total.
* Getting an app's display name.
* You have to run the iOS app and tap start broadcasting in order for the Mac client to see the ANCS service. (No clue on that)
* There's no UI. Just watch the log messages.
* Best way to see it in action is get yourself all connected up and then send yourself an iMessage.
* now it could hangup incoming calls and clear existsing notification.
